            <p id = "text1">This project aims to increase the number of green roofs in cities. Green roofs not only provide additional areas for vegetation, but also help reduce the urban heat island effect, improve air quality and support biodiversity. The project involves training local residents in how to create and maintain green roofs, as well as partnering with local companies to install them on their buildings.</p>

            <p id = "text2">This project aims to restore and protect marine reefs, key elements of the world's ocean ecosystems. The project team will conduct research on the condition of the reefs, restore damaged areas and develop monitoring programs to prevent further destruction. The project also includes educational programs for local communities and tourists to raise awareness of the importance of protecting marine ecosystems.</p>

            <p id = "text3">The goal of this project is to create urban farms equipped with solar panels for sustainable food production in cities. These farms will use innovative vertical farming techniques while minimizing water and energy consumption. The project will also involve local residents in farm maintenance and provide access to fresh, organic produce in urban areas.</p>
