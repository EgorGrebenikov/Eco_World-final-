                    It all started by 4 people : Egor Grebennikov , Daniela Stoilova , Nikolay Zhelyazkov and Stefan
                    Radev. The idea to create a crew was because these four people realized how years have passed and
                    the Earth hasn't done any progress towards helping it. And so , their thoughts became identical -
                    saving the world from pollution.
