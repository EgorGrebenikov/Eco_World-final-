                <span>We, EcoWorld, are a team associated with fundings and saving the world from pollution. As we are
                    curtain that we cannot save every country , we could at least make one's wish fulfilled. We are one
                    of the "fingers" of god that can create and make it into a reality , being a good example of people
                    what to do.</span>
                <span>It all started by 4 people : Egor Grebennikov , Daniela Stoilova , Nikolay Zhelyazkov and Stefan
                    Radev. The idea to create a crew was because these four people realized how years have passed and
                    the Earth hasn't done any progress towards helping it. And so , their thoughts became identical -
                    saving the world from pollution.</span>
