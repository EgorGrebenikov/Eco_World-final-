                        <h2>WHO WE ARE</h2>
                        <p>We, EcoWorld, are a team associated with fundings and saving the world from pollution. As we are curtain that we cannot save every country , we could at least make one's wish fulfilled. We are one of the "fingers" of god that can create and make it into a reality , being a good example of people what to do.</p>
                        
                        
                       
                        <p>It all started by 4 people : Egor Grebennikov , Daniela Stoilova , Nikolay Zhelyazkov and Stefan Radev. The idea to create a crew was because these four people realized how years have passed and the Earth hasn't done any progress towards helping it. And so ,  their thoughts became identical - saving the world from pollution.</p>

                            <p>In Bulgaria , the pollution is increasing drastically , giving us a sign where to go. Sofia - Bulgaria's capital and many cities have their lands with many things that can be harmful in it. And so , our objective is protect their streets from garbage.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Our Team indicates in Sofia , where all candidates can volunteer. There are no requirements to participate in the job - we just have to look at your id so we can confirm your identity.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>We are separated into 4 teams: East , West, North and South Bulgarian team. Each team has its own intentions what to do :  Cleaning the streets , planting trees , cleaning lakes and the Black sea(Only available inside the East team) from plastic  and so on. These types of events can commonly happen on Sunday , making it quite easy for people to join.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Sometimes , we even host giveaways to those who participate a lot!  Whoever's team has done more things within a month, gets a shirt with our logo and a cap! </p>
